        <h2>
2018: The Year of the the Blockchain
        </h2>
<div align="left">
<p>2017
was an unprecendented year in crypto. Bitcoin went from around £750
in January to the heady heights of £14,500 in December.<br></p><p><br>

</p><p>From
around May onwards the market saw a huge inflow of new people. I
watched Facebook pages such as Cryptocurrency Collectors Club grew
from a couple of thousand members to over 30k within a very short
period of time (now the largest page on Facebook now boasts over 100k
members). Bitcoin was the tide that many projects rose on and the
market became a beacon for investors from across the board. 
</p><p><br>

</p><p>The
Christmas season saw a repeat performance of previous years with big
sell offs and now at the beginning of 2018 all eyes are on the market
to see if this year will improve on last or pave the way for a drawn
out bear market.</p><p><br>

</p><p>I
think that 2018 will eclipse 2017 beyond all recognition and here’s
why.</p><p><br>

</p><p><b>The
SEC and CTFC Testimonial February 6<sup>th</sup> 2018</b></p><p><br>

</p><p>
The SEC (Securities Exchange
Commission) and the CTFC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) are
two regulatory bodies in America. Regulation has been a primary
source for FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) in the market and has
historically seen big sell offs.</p><p>
<br>

</p><p>
Here’s what came out of a
recent hearing of testimonials from Jay Clayton and J. Christopher
Giancarlo.</p><p>
<br>

</p><p><b>Technology:</b></p><p>
<br>

</p><blockquote><p>
‘<i>It’s also important to
note that the technology innovation and ideas underlying these
markets present significant positive potential. These aspects
underpinning virtual currencies have the ability to transform for
investors the composition of and the ability to access the financial
landscape.Thus changing and modernising capital formation and
transfer of risk. Technology is forward looking and we look to our
regulators to continue carrying out their mandates including investor
protection as market evolve.’ </i>
</p></blockquote><p>
<br>

</p><p>
Senator
Mike Crapo
opening the February 6<sup>th</sup>
2018 Senate Testimony on cryptocurrencies</p><p><br>

</p><blockquote><p>
‘<i>To be clear, I am very
optimistic that developments in financial technology will help
facilitate capital formation, providing promising investment
opportunities for institutional and Main Street investors alike. From
a financial regulatory perspective, these developments may enable us
to better monitor transactions, holdings and obligations (including
credit exposures) and other activities and characteristics of our
markets, thereby facilitating our regulatory mission, including,
importantly, investor protection.’</i></p></blockquote><p>
<br>

</p><p>
Jay
Clayton, Chairman SEC</p><p>
<br>

</p><blockquote><p>
‘<i>I
have spoken publicly about the potential benefits of the technology
underlying Bitcoin, namely Blockchain or distributed ledger
technology (DLT). Distributed ledgers – in various open system or
private network applications – have the potential to enhance
economic efficiency, mitigate centralized systemic risk, defend
against fraudulent activity and improve data quality and governance.</i></p><p>
<br>

</p><p>
<i>DLT
is likely to have a broad and lasting impact on global financial
markets in payments, banking, securities settlement, title recording,
cyber security and trade reporting and analysis. When tied to virtual
currencies, this technology aims to serve as a new store of value,
facilitate secure payments, enable asset transfers, and power new
applications. </i>
</p><p>
<br>

</p><p>
<i>Additionally,
DLT will likely develop hand-in-hand with new “smart” contracts
that can value themselves in real-time, report themselves to data
repositories, automatically calculate and perform margin payments and
even terminate themselves in the event of counterparty default.</i></p><p>
<br>

</p><p><i>DLT
may enable financial market participants to manage the significant
operational, transactional and capital
complexities brought about by the many mandates, regulations and
capital requirements promulgated by regulators here and abroad in the
wake of the financial crisis. In fact, one study estimates that DLT
could eventually allow financial institutions to save as much as $20
billion in infrastructure and operational costs each year. Another
study reportedly estimates that blockchain could cut trading
settlement costs by a third, or $16 billion a year, and cut capital
requirements by $120 billion. Moving from systems-of-record at the
level of a firm to an authoritative system-of-record at the level of
a market is an enormous opportunity to improve existing market
infrastructure. </i>
</p><p><br>

</p><p><i>Outside
of the financial services industry, many use cases for DLT are being
posited from international trade to charitable endeavors and social
services. International agricultural commodities merchant, Louis
Dreyfus, and a group of financing banks have just completed the first
agricultural deal using distributed ledger technology for the sale of
60,000 tons of US soybeans to China. Other DLT use cases include:
legal records management, inventory control and logistics, charitable
donation tracking and confirmation; voting security and human refugee
identification and relocation. &nbsp;</i>
</p><p><br>

</p><p><i>Yet,
while DLT promises enormous benefits to commercial firms and
charities, it also promises assistance to financial market regulators
in meeting their mission to oversee healthy markets and mitigate
financial risk. What a difference it would have made on the eve of
the financial crisis in 2008 if regulators had access to the
real-time trading ledgers of large Wall Street banks, rather than
trying to assemble piecemeal data to recreate complex, individual
trading portfolios. I have previously speculated32 that, if
regulators in 2008 could have viewed a real-time distributed ledger
(or a series of aggregated ledgers across asset classes) and,
perhaps, been able to utilize modern cognitive computing
capabilities, they may have been able to recognize anomalies in
market-wide trading activity and diverging counterparty exposures
indicating heightened risk of bank failure. Such transparency may
not, by itself, have saved Lehman Brothers from bankruptcy, but it
certainly would have allowed for far prompter, betterinformed, and
more calibrated regulatory intervention instead of the disorganized
response that unfortunately ensued.’</i></p></blockquote><p>
<br>

</p><p>
J. Christopher Giancarlo
Chairman CTFC 
</p><p>
<br>

</p><p><b>Market:</b></p><p>
<br>

</p><blockquote><p>
‘<i>Perspective is critically
important. As of the morning of February 5, the total value of all
outstanding Bitcoin was about $130 billion based on a Bitcoin price
of $7,700. The Bitcoin “market capitalization” is less than the
stock market capitalization of a single “large cap” business,
such as McDonalds (around $130 billion). The total value of all
outstanding virtual currencies was about $365 billion. Because
virtual currencies like Bitcoin are sometimes considered to be
comparable to gold as an investment vehicle, it is important to
recognize that the total value of all the gold in the world is
estimated by the World Gold Council to be about $8 trillion which
continues to dwarf the virtual currency market size. Clearly, the
column inches of press attention to virtual currency far surpass its
size and magnitude in today’s global economy.’</i></p></blockquote><p><br>

</p><p>
<br>

</p><p><b>TL;DR?
After researching blockchain America’s two most prominent
regulatory bodies have found that the tech is profoundly innovative
with the potential to reshape global business and finance positively
and the market is still in its infancy and relatively small.</b></p><p>
<br>

</p><p>If
this came
from a Twitter account called ‘CryptoCool’ you would rightfully
take it with a pinch of salt, however, this comes
from representatives of the
SEC and the CTFC.</p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>We
are at the beginning of a market for
a technology which has
the potential to disrupt and
reshape business and finance across the board.</i></p><p>
<i>They even </i><i>note that</i><i>
</i><i>blockchain can be utilised to improve </i><i>financial
regulation. </i><i>T</i><i>hey’re sold because it’ll</i><i> </i><i>make
their job easier!</i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>I
personally can’t think of anything more
bullish.</p><p>
<br>

</p><p>However,
as with all
emerging markets
there are
real risks.
There are a lot of
fraudulent practices
capitalising on lack of regulation and general naivety in
the market. Crypto
has largely evolved
virally
online
so ‘retail’ or ‘main street’ investors are
coming in and are
often easy
targets for scams.

</p><p>
<br>

</p><p>Some
kind of regulation is
absolutely necessary not
only to protect new investors but also to protect the reputation of
this new technology and its innovation.</p><p>
<br>

</p><p>
So how can you sift through the
1000’s of projects out there and have any assurance as to who is
legitimate and who isn’t?</p><p>
<br>

</p><p><b>Enter
Stage Enterprise</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p>
The lure of blockchain for
enterprise is strong with or without regulation. 
</p><p>
<br>

</p><p>
The above stats on how much
money blockchain can save institutions gives a very immediate reason
as to why enterprises are jumping in. Businesses have to be seen to
be competitive. Shareholders won’t be happy if their investment is
getting left behind in the stone-age. 
</p><p>
<br>

</p><p>
Historically we’ve seen
blockchain start ups partnering with big brands and benefiting from
the legitimacy of association and consequent flood of money that’ll
flow into the project (Ethereum’s partnership with Microsoft early
on was one of the reasons I got in just before Homestead was
launched). Now we’re seeing companies announcing their involvement
with blockchain projects with a similar fervour so as to prove <i>their</i>
legitimacy in keeping up with new technology.</p><p>
<br>

</p><p>
Industries across the board are
trialling or even implementing blockchain. Retail, automotive,
aviation, supply chain, TIC, auditing, government, finance, the list
goes on. Even BNSF, the railway company owned by huge blockchain
sceptic Warren Buffet, is now signed up to the Blockchain in
Transport Alliance
(<a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-berkshire-bnsf-blockchain/buffetts-bnsf-railroad-eyes-blockchain-for-shipping-freight-idUKKBN1FP2L3">https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-berkshire-bnsf-blockchain/buffetts-bnsf-railroad-eyes-blockchain-for-shipping-freight-idUKKBN1FP2L3</a>).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>
So enterprise adoption can be a
great starting point for a seeing if a project is legitimate or not. 
</p><p>
<br>

</p><p>
There are some pretty important
questions new investors should ask when they’re researching a
project that’s caught their eye. Does the project solve a real
world problem? Do they have a team that can deliver? Have they
already secured partnerships that can implement their solution? 
</p><p>
<br>

</p><p>For
example: if you were comparing two projects, would
you feel more comfortable putting money into a one
that has a proven working partnership with one of the ‘big four’
auditing companies well
known for their diligence and analysis of businesses worldwide; or
a project with an anonymous team and a white paper full of grand
ideas but
no way of delivering them?</p><p>
<br>

</p><p>There
are moves for the market to be self regulating
(<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cftc-official-backs-winklevoss-brothers-crypto-self-regulation-bid/">https://www.coindesk.com/cftc-official-backs-winklevoss-brothers-crypto-self-regulation-bid/</a>)
and as
an
example
of basic
free
market economics, enterprise
adoption can
pave the way for a
stronger
market. Vapour-ware projects without
partnerships or the teams to realise their vision will
fall away, leaving projects with strong fundamentals serving the
needs of enterprise.

</p><p><br></p><p>
No
doubt in the future we’ll see the market
regulated by blockchain itself.</p><p><br></p><p>But surely large
companies coming into the market will go for private blockchain
companies or simply make their own and lock out retail investors?</p><p><br>

</p><p>In terms of making
their own private blockchain it’s really not so easy plus why make
your own when you can use a project on the market that’s already
tried and tested project and offering the exact service you need. The
resources it would take to get up to speed with already active
projects would be costly and potentially put the company behind the
curve. It’s more efficient to outsource.</p><p><br>

</p><p>In terms of private
vs public there are instances of big corporate entities trialling
private blockchain (such as Maersk using Guardtime KSI), however, the
argument for public blockchains over private is a very easy one.
Public blockchains mitigate risk by tokenising data. If a company’s
data is monopolised by one centralized intermediary, it’s handing
over a lot of control, responsibility and ultimately power to one
entity. 
</p><p><br>

</p><p>The public
tokenisation of data that tracks trillions of fiat value transfers
will be essential for the scale needed for enterprise adoption. The
prospect of tokenising the goods valued in fiat then leads to the
prospect of the tokenisation of fiat currencies which takes us from
enterprise adoption to something far more compelling.</p><p><br></p><p><b>The Rise of the
Blockchain State</b></p><p><br>

</p><p>
Above
we looked into the eye of the FUD storm that is regulation and seen
that at its heart, &nbsp;sentiment is incredibly positive. Now lets delve
into another faithful source of FUD within the market: China.</p><p><br></p><p>
China
has a huge influence over the market.
In
June 2017 it was estimated that around 70% of all Bitcoin mining
happened in China. In
January 2017 it was estimated that 98% of crypto trading volume came
from China.

</p><p><br></p><p>
The
smallest of
noises
from China’s
government
has
historically sent
shockwaves through
the space. This
culminated to
a point in
September 2017 when
China ‘banned Bitcoin’.
This
was the
headline that was leapt
on by media outlets across the board. Bitcoin
was dead. Crypto was scam. The Wolf of Wall Street guy was right all
along! 
</p><p><br></p><p>
However,
on
closer inspection, like with the SEC and CTFC hearing, the Chinese
government is
clearly pro-blockchain.
There
was speculation that the timing of the announcements coincided
brilliantly with the lead up to China’s ‘elections’ (19<sup>th</sup>
National Congress of the Communist Party of China) and played into
the narrative
of a strong governing hand over the economic welfare of the country.
As
with the SEC and CTFC they want proper regulation and
controls
in place, however,
the key
word in
this case is
‘control’.

</p><p><br></p><p>
We
are seeing
very
clear signs that China are set to become a world leader in applying
blockchain tech. Recently
The People’s Daily (the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist
Party) printed a feature endorsing blockchain.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>
<i>‘We
should plow deep into technology in the hope that through
technological superiority we will be invincible in the future
international blockchain competition, but If you are anxious to build
a castle on a not-so-strong foundation, it is quite possible that you
will lose.’</i></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>
Dou
Jiali. Researcher at
Peking
University Guanghua Financial Technology Laboratory Researcher. The
People’s Daily</p><p><br></p><p>
The
same drive that is luring enterprise onto the blockchain also exists
for nation states and
I believe that this drive is down to what has rapidly become
recognised as ‘new oil’ and this is big data.</p><p><br></p><p>
<b>Tokenisation:</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p>
China
is already
close to being a cashless
society. QR payments are increasingly
popular but PboC are concerned about security risks and unfair market
competition so
there’s been much speculation about a
state run digital currency in the pipelines. However,
this is a pretty simple understanding of China’s approach to
blockchain. Blockchain offers many
possibilities beyond currency. 

</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>
‘<i>The
foundation of this high-value future is the concept of tokenization:
representing a company's products and services as digital tokens on a
blockchain, not merely as items of information, but as carriers of
value.</i></p><p>
<i>Such
digital tokens can stand for anything from pharmaceuticals to phones
to music. Whatever they are, they should have assigned ownership and
value. If you have a pallet of 1,000 mobile phones, each worth
$1,000, that's on a ship in transit, the blockchain should represent
that with 1,000 small tokens with a collective value of $1 million.</i></p><p>
<i>When
products are made, delivered or sold, value in the blockchain can
change hands: 1,000 phone tokens for $1 million in U.S. dollar
tokens. Not just bitcoin or ether, but U.S. dollar. Or euros or yen
for that matter.</i></p><p>
<i>Set
aside the debate about the value of traditional fiat vs.
cryptocurrencies for the long run. The simple fact is that enterprise
CFOs want to be paid the same currencies in which they have expenses
and long-term liabilities.</i></p><p>
<i>That
means tokenizing traditional fiat currency and doing so in the same
blockchain as the products and services are tokenized.’</i></p><p><i><br></i></p></blockquote><p>

technology at Ernst

</p><p><br></p><p>
So
here we see the potential for a far more all encompassing application
of blockchain. 
</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>
<b>Smart
Cities</b></p><p><br></p><p>
In
December
2017
it
was announced
that
Gui’an
was
to become a
new Free Trade Zone. It’s
earmarked to
become one of the most important national level data centre clusters
in China and
a &nbsp;model that
is intended to
be rolled out on a national level.</p><p><br></p><p>
This
New Area will be run on a public blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p>
Business
registration related documents, such as a business certificates,
bank account certificates,
tax registrations,
organization codes,
foreign trade registrations,
audit reports,
etc are
already stored on the blockchain by the The Administrative
Examination and Approval Bureau of Gui’an New Area. Administration,
agriculture, retail, transport, energy trading
and
much more are
all
set
to
be run on the blockchain as
well.
Gui’an
will also introduce a
physical goods exchange for
wine
(the provenance of which is verified by blockchain) run on the
blockchain, providing
a test bed for a future exchange for a range of products. Imagine
an Alibaba for authentic goods.

</p><p><br></p><p>
In
Gui’an we
are seeing the realisation of value transfer on the blockchain with
tokens being the carriers of that value. For
anyone who’s seen the rapid rise of cities like Shenzhen, the
prospect of what is about to be realised in Gui’an is very
compelling. 
</p><p>
<br>
<br>

</p><p>
As
with the SEC and CTFC hearing we see that at the heart of the FUD
storm of ‘China banning Bitcoin’ is
the very clear prospect that China realises that adopting blockchain
technology first will give them the competitive advantage
internationally. 
</p><p>
<br>
<br>

</p><p>
