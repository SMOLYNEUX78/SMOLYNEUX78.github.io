<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">2017 was an
unprecendented year in crypto. Bitcoin went from around £750 in
January to the heady heights of £14,500 in December. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">From around May
onwards the market saw a huge inflow of new people. I watched
Facebook pages such as Cryptocurrency Collectors Club grow from a
couple of thousand members to over 30k within a very short period of
time (now the largest page on Facebook boasts over 100k members).
Bitcoin was the tide that many projects rose on and the market became
a beacon for investors from across the board. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The Christmas season
saw a repeat performance of previous years with big sell offs and now
at the beginning of 2018 all eyes are on the market to see if this
year will improve on last or pave the way for a drawn out bear
market.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">I think that 2018
will eclipse 2017 beyond all recognition and here’s why.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The SEC (Securities
Exchange Commission) and the CTFC (Commodity Futures Trading
Commission) are two regulatory bodies in America. Regulation has been
a primary source for FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) in the market
and has historically seen big sell offs.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">At the core of a
recent hearing, two quotes from J. Christopher Giancarlo of the CTFC
spoke volumes about the market.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><span style="background: #dddddd"><b>...
one study estimates that DLT could eventually allow financial
institutions to save as much as $20 billion in infrastructure and

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><span style="background: #dddddd">Yet,
while DLT promises enormous benefits to commercial firms and
charities, it also promises assistance to financial market regulators
in meeting their mission to oversee healthy markets and mitigate
financial risk. What a difference it would have made on the eve of
the financial crisis in 2008 if regulators had access to the
real-time trading ledgers of large Wall Street banks, rather than
trying to assemble piecemeal data to recreate complex, individual
trading portfolios.’</span></p>

value of all outstanding Bitcoin was about $130 billion based on a

virtual currencies like Bitcoin are sometimes considered to be
comparable to gold as an investment vehicle, it is important to
recognize that the total value of all the gold in the world is
estimated by the World Gold Council to be about $8 trillion which

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><b>After researching
blockchain America’s two most prominent regulatory bodies have
found that the tech is profoundly innovative with the potential to
reshape global business and finance positively and the market is
still in its infancy and relatively small.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">If this came from a
Twitter account called ‘CryptoCool’ you would rightfully take it
with a pinch of salt, however, this comes from representatives of the
SEC and the CTFC.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><i>They even note
that blockchain can be utilised to improve financial regulation.
They’re sold because it’ll make their job easier!  </i>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">I personally can’t
think of anything more bullish.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">However, as with all
new markets there are risks. There are a lot of fraudulent practices
capitalising on lack of regulation and general naivety in the market.
Crypto has largely evolved virally online so ‘retail’ or ‘main
street’ investors are coming in and are often easy targets for
scams. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Some kind of
regulation is absolutely necessary not only to protect new investors
but also to protect the reputation of this new technology and its
innovation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">So how can you sift
through the 1000’s of projects out there and have any assurance as
to who is legitimate and who isn’t? 
</p>

Enterprise</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The lure of
blockchain for enterprise is strong with or without regulation. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The above stats on
how much money blockchain can save institutions gives a very
immediate reason as to why enterprises are jumping in. Businesses
have to be seen to be competitive. Shareholders won’t be happy if
their investment is getting left behind in the stone-age. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Historically we’ve
seen blockchain start ups partnering with big brands and benefiting
from the legitimacy of association and consequent flood of money
that’ll flow into the project (Ethereum’s partnership with
Microsoft early on was one of the reasons I got in just before
Homestead was launched). Now we’re seeing companies announcing
their involvement with blockchain projects with a similar fervour so
as to prove their legitimacy in keeping up with new technology.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Industries across
the board are trialling or even implementing blockchain. Retail,
automotive, aviation, supply chain, TIC, auditing, government,
finance, the list goes on. Even BNSF, the railway company owned by
huge blockchain sceptic Warren Buffet, is now signed up to the
Blockchain in Transport Alliance
(<a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-berkshire-bnsf-blockchain/buffetts-bnsf-railroad-eyes-blockchain-for-shipping-freight-idUKKBN1FP2L3"><font style="font-size: 10pt">https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-berkshire-bnsf-blockchain/buffetts-bnsf-railroad-eyes-blockchain-for-shipping-freight-idUKKBN1FP2L3</font></a>).
  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">So enterprise
adoption can be a great starting point for a seeing if a project is
legitimate or not. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">There are some
pretty important questions new investors should ask when they’re
researching a project that’s caught their eye. Does the project
solve a real world problem? Do they have a team that can deliver?
Have they already secured partnerships that can implement their
solution? 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">For example: if you
were comparing two projects, would you feel more comfortable putting
money into a one that has a proven working partnership with one of
the ‘big four’ auditing companies well known for their diligence
and analysis of businesses worldwide; or a project with an anonymous
team and a white paper full of grand ideas but no way of delivering
them?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">There are moves for
the market to be self regulating
(<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cftc-official-backs-winklevoss-brothers-crypto-self-regulation-bid/"><font style="font-size: 10pt">https://www.coindesk.com/cftc-official-backs-winklevoss-brothers-crypto-self-regulation-bid/</font></a>)and
 as an example of basic free market economics, enterprise adoption
can pave the way for a stronger market. Vapour-ware projects without
partnerships or the teams to realise their vision will fall away,
leaving projects with strong fundamentals serving the needs of
enterprise. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">No doubt in the
future we’ll see the market regulated by blockchain itself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">But surely large
companies coming into the market will go for private blockchain
companies or simply make their own and lock out retail investors?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">In terms of making
their own private blockchain it’s really not so easy plus why make
your own when you can use a project on the market that’s already
tried and tested project and offering the exact service you need. The
resources it would take to get up to speed with already active
projects would be costly and potentially put the company behind the
curve. It’s more efficient to outsource.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">In terms of private
vs public there are instances of big corporate entities trialling
private blockchain (such as Maersk using Guardtime KSI), however, the
argument for public blockchains over private is a very easy one.
Public blockchains mitigate risk by tokenising data. If a company’s
data is monopolised by one centralized intermediary, it’s handing
over a lot of control, responsibility and ultimately power to one
entity. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The public
tokenisation of data that tracks trillions of fiat value transfers
will be essential for the scale needed for enterprise adoption. The
prospect of tokenising the goods valued in fiat then leads to the
prospect of the tokenisation of fiat currencies which takes us from
enterprise adoption to something far more compelling.</p>

on closer inspection, like with the SEC and CTFC hearing, the Chinese
government is clearly pro-blockchain. There was speculation that the
timing of the announcements coincided brilliantly with the lead up to
China’s ‘elections’ (19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China) and played into the narrative of a strong governing
hand over the economic welfare of the country. As with the SEC and
CTFC they want proper regulation and controls in place, however, the
key word in this case is ‘control’. </span></em>

wine (the provenance of which is verified by blockchain) run on the

infrastructures will be realised in parts of the world that need it
most and people will be better equipped to lift themselves out of
poverty. Large scale financial crashes created by the few and paid
